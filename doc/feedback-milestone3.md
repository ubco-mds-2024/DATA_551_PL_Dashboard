#### Feedback:

"The title font was a great choice for the type of data being presented, so I would recommend extending this font style throughout the entire dashboard to create a consistent look"

#### Feedback:

"Regarding the two bottom-most plots (Goals over Time and Goals per Season). I was uncertain about how they differed from one another, so I thought that it may be helpful to include a brief text description to clarify."

#### Feedback:

"when selecting a lot of teams, the percentages would get cut off by the legend. Add titles to filter bars (teams, seasons)"

#### Feedback:

"For Wins Over Time ... Unclear about colour coding. I was seeing multiple colours for the same team."

#### Response:

We will have to look into if this is a bug, but part of this problem might be that many teams have a similar colour in the theme. We neeed to redesign the timelines anyways, so we will try to keep in mind better differentiation between teams. This could be with explicit labels, or a more helpful
figure legend. If possible, we will try to have each team represented by two theme colours, which should reduce the instances where team colours look so similar.

#### Feedback:

"For Wins Over Time ... Would be cool to see losses on this chart as a comparison (maybe as greyed out dots?)."

#### Response:

This is a good suggestion but we will have to see how it looks after redesigning the timelines (which needs to be done anyways for other reasons above). If it doesn't look too busy (after a redesign) then we will also include losses on this chart. If this clutters the plot too much, we
will either include losses as a separate statistic that can be viewed, or include a toggle where it can be turned on/off on the wins over time plot.

#### Feedback:

"As a non soccer viewer, I was able to understand most of the data effectively but certain things left a few questions. For example, how many total games are in a season? I know this team had 24 wins in this season, but I donâ€™t know if that means the team performed well."

#### Response:

This is a useful suggestion. All of our group members watch soccer and so we might not have considered some questions like this. We will keep this feedback in mind when designing the next iteration of the dashboard, and we will include some comments where helpful
(such as changing a figure caption `Wins per Season` to `Wins per Season (38 total games)`) and if there is still some missing information, perhaps include an "info button" that pops up with a summary of some useful background knowledge.
