## Premier League Dashboard

#### Has it been easy to use your app?

Yes, it’s been easy to use our app, and we believe our app will be easy to use by others. This partly due to its straightforward functionality, our Premier League Dashboard is designed to provide clear, concise visualizations for team performances. Based on feedback we added an info button to familiarize users who don't know the rules or format of the league. Although we had a huge number of statistics available to us in the raw data, we chose to keep things simple and clear. A minor setback or challenge using our app is how the axis system tends to be a little finicky to change and adjust, but this can usually be resolved by resetting the axis of the plot. This primarily occurs in the line charts.

#### Are there recurring themes in your feedback on what is good and what can be improved?

We found that the feedback we generally received was more targeted at surface level aesthetic suggestions versus larger logical changes in what we could show in our dashboard. The primary recurring theme would be improving the clarity of our dashboard. These included things such as adjusting line chart heights, clarifying similar graphs, better color differentiation and refining design consistencies. We believed all of this feedback to be valid. One piece of feedback we weren't able to implement was making team colours more differentiable. We hoped to have multiple colours associated with a team, such that each team gets a palette rather than a single colour (which are sometimes hard to tell apart) but we struggled to make this consistent.

#### Is there any feedback (or other insight) that you have found particularly valuable during your dashboard development?

An important piece of feedback was to fix our bottom timeline, which we updated to be different for both goals and wins statistics, and instead show cumulative goals over the time frame selected. This allows for a more "narrative" viewing of the data. As mentioned above, we also got this feedback: "As a non soccer viewer, I was able to understand most of the data effectively but certain things left a few questions. For example, how many total games are in a season? I know this team had 24 wins in this season, but I don’t know if that means the team performed well." This highlighted a gap in contextual information. Although we intended the dashboard for soccer fans, we recognize now it should be more accessible to all users. This motivated us to implement an info button to provide background knowledge on league structure and team performance.
