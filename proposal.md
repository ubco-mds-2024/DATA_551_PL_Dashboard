## Section 1: Motivation and Purpose

The English Premier League, the most-watched sports league in the world, generates billions in revenue each year. It has the highest aggregate attendance across a season and holds the top UEFA coefficient, making it the highest level domestic football league. With sports betting being a $500 billion industry, any insights into team performances and match outcomes could be extremely valuable. We believe this dashboard will be beneficial for all football fans, from casual spectators to club managers and sports bettors. By visualizing 20 years of EPL match data including both on and off the pitch factors, our dashboard will provide summaries of team performances, team matchups, and allow users to filter and subset visualizations to highlight key metrics. Through interactive plots and comparisons, our dashboard will help users identify patterns, explore historical trends, and analyze betting odds, offering a deeper understanding of the game.

## Section 2: Description of the Data


Our dataset, sourced from [Football-Data.co.uk](https://www.football-data.co.uk/), compiles match results and statistics from reputable sources such as XScores, BBC, and ESPN, while also incorporating betting odds from multiple bookmakers. It spans roughly 20 years of English Premiere League play, with each match observation representing a single match. Every match record includes standard metrics like date, home team, away team, goals, and shots, as well as detailed information on fouls committed, cards issued, and offside calls. The data also contains pre-closing betting odds for home wins, draws, and away wins available from individual bookmakers and aggregated for maximum and average market odds. By bringing together both on field and off the pitch variables, we aim to uncover deeper insights into how these factors intertwine to shape match outcomes.

## Section 3: Research Questions and Usage Scenarios


Our dashboard is designed to provide insights by allowing users to filter teams and seasons, compare match outcomes, and examine long term trends. The dashboard enables meaningful exploration of historical Premiere League data through interactive visualizations such as pie charts, bar charts, and line charts, users can look at trends in wins, goals scored, and overall team performance.  

For example, Jamal is a football analyst working for a sports media outlet. He is preparing a report on the historical performance of top Premiere League teams and wants to compare the win rates of Tottenham, Chelsea, and Liverpool over the past two decades. Using the dashboard, he selects these teams in the filter panel and immediately sees their total wins and goal counts represented in a bar chart. He also notices a timeline visualization tracking seasonal trends, where he identifies peaks in Tottenham's success in the late 2000s and Liverpoolâ€™s rise in the late 2010s. By further refining the filters, he isolates specific seasons to compare short term fluctuations with longterm dominance. This enables Jamal to present a data driven narrative about the shifting power dynamics in the league.  

The dashboard is also useful for league wide analysis. For instance, a researcher studying goal trends over time might use the tool to examine whether goal scoring has increased in the Premier League over the years. By setting the filters to include all teams and selecting "Goals Scored" as the variable of interest, the user can observe patterns in goal output across different eras of the league. This might reveal whether rule changes, tactical shifts, or player styles have contributed to more high scoring matches in recent years.
