    "# Teamwork Contract\n",
    "\n",
    "Group members agree to distribute work evenly such that the combined effort results in a satisfactory product. Additional work to achieve exceptional quality or to implement features outside the basic scope of the project does not need to be evenly distributed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Group members will strive to complete their portion of tasks at least 24 hours before the due date to allow time for review and integration. Each member is responsible for ensuring that their work meets a reasonable standard of quality before submission.\n",
    "\n",
    "All group members agree to meet during the designated lab time if any member requests. Other meeting times can be arranged as needed but are not mandatory under this contract. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each team member is expected to dedicate sufficient time to the project each week to ensure steady progress and meet deadlines.  General availability will be discussed at the start of the project, with an understanding that all members should be reachable for coordination as deadlines approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any conflicting decisions arising from disagreements about the direction of the project shall be resolved by a majority vote. However, considering our group consists of only two people, this logic presents a potential dilemma. This contract states that our team will then attempt to resolve conflicts through a thumb war. If a thumb war proves to be an unsatisfactory way to settle the dispute, the matter shall be escalated to a third party, such as the Professor or TA."
